# Exam_Ostad

### ** Exam Instructions:**
- Follow this UI. You have to create a screen like this with the help of TextFormField, and ElevatedButton widget

# **Issues**:
> We can use logic for name, age, and salary as we learned in Module 08, Class 02.
 but the question does not require it, here I only use the TextFormField and ElevatedButton widgets to create the exact UI of the following questions.
 but we may use controller as we learn from the class to make this UI more user friendly

# **Notes:**
>
- During upload the full project file into github, I've faced some of problems,
 so that i only submit the main 2 files that i use to run my project in VS code.
